Test 0-:
    W0: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W1: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W2: [ 0] < [ 2]
    Truth table result: ['0-'] is correct

Test 0+:
    W0: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W1: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W2: [ 0] > [ 2]
    Truth table result: ['0+'] is correct

Test 1-:
    W0: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W1: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W2: [ 0] = [ 2]
    Truth table result: ['1-'] is correct

Test 1+:
    W0: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W1: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W2: [ 0] = [ 2]
    Truth table result: ['1+'] is correct

Test 2-:
    W0: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W1: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W2: [ 0] > [ 2]
    Truth table result: ['2-'] is correct

Test 2+:
    W0: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W1: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W2: [ 0] < [ 2]
    Truth table result: ['2+'] is correct

Total correct results: 6
Total incorrect results: 0
