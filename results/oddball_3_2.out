Solving for 3 balls and 2 weighings.
Using symmetry breaking strategy TruthTableAscending.

Solution:
W0: [ 0] <=> [ 1]
W1: [ 1] <=> [ 2]

Truth Table:
ix  W0  W1   Result
 0   <   <
 1   <   =   0-
 2   <   >   1+
 3   =   <   2+
 4   =   =
 5   =   >   2-
 6   >   <   1-
 7   >   =   0+
 8   >   >

Test 0-:
    W0: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W1: [ 1] = [ 2]
    Truth table row=[<, =] ix=1 result=[0-] is correct

Test 0+:
    W0: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W1: [ 1] = [ 2]
    Truth table row=[>, =] ix=7 result=[0+] is correct

Test 1-:
    W0: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W1: [ 1] < [ 2]
    Truth table row=[>, <] ix=6 result=[1-] is correct

Test 1+:
    W0: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W1: [ 1] > [ 2]
    Truth table row=[<, >] ix=2 result=[1+] is correct

Test 2-:
    W0: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W1: [ 1] > [ 2]
    Truth table row=[=, >] ix=5 result=[2-] is correct

Test 2+:
    W0: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W1: [ 1] < [ 2]
    Truth table row=[=, <] ix=3 result=[2+] is correct

Total correct results: 6
Total incorrect results: 0
