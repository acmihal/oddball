Solving for 3 balls and 2 weighings

Solution:
W0: [ 0] <=> [ 1]
W1: [ 2] <=> [ 1]

Truth Table:
ix  W0  W1   Result
 0   <   <   1+
 1   <   =   0-
 2   <   >
 3   =   <   2-
 4   =   =
 5   =   >   2+
 6   >   <
 7   >   =   0+
 8   >   >   1-

Test 0-:
    W0: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W1: [ 2] = [ 1]
    Truth table result: ['0-'] is correct

Test 0+:
    W0: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W1: [ 2] = [ 1]
    Truth table result: ['0+'] is correct

Test 1-:
    W0: [ 0] > [ 1]
    W1: [ 2] > [ 1]
    Truth table result: ['1-'] is correct

Test 1+:
    W0: [ 0] < [ 1]
    W1: [ 2] < [ 1]
    Truth table result: ['1+'] is correct

Test 2-:
    W0: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W1: [ 2] < [ 1]
    Truth table result: ['2-'] is correct

Test 2+:
    W0: [ 0] = [ 1]
    W1: [ 2] > [ 1]
    Truth table result: ['2+'] is correct

Total correct results: 6
Total incorrect results: 0
